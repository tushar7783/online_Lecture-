Hereâ€™s a backend project idea using Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB:

Project Title: Online Learning Platform API

Description

Build an API for an online learning platform where users can sign up, enroll in courses, and track their progress. This platform would serve as the backend for an ed-tech application.


---

Features

1. Authentication and Authorization

Users can sign up, log in, and log out using JWT authentication.

Role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Instructor, Student).


2. User Management

Students can update their profiles.

Admins can manage users (add, delete, and update).


3. Course Management

Instructors can:

Create, update, or delete courses.

Upload course materials like videos or PDFs (store file links in MongoDB).


Students can:

Browse available courses.

Enroll in courses.



4. Progress Tracking

Track completion status for each module/lesson of a course.

Students can mark lessons as complete.


5. Rating and Feedback

Students can rate courses and leave feedback.

Display average ratings for each course.


6. Search and Filter

Search courses by category, instructor, or keyword.

Filter courses by price, rating, or duration.

Database Models (Using Mongoose)

1. User Model

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: { type: String, unique: true },
  password: String,
  role: { type: String, enum: ['Admin', 'Instructor', 'Student'], default: 'Student' },
});
module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);


2. Course Model

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const courseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  description: String,
  instructor: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
  category: String,
  lessons: [{ title: String, content: String }],
  price: Number,
  rating: { type: Number, default: 0 },
});
module.exports = mongoose.model('Course', courseSchema);


3. Enrollment Model

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const enrollmentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  student: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
  course: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Course' },
  progress: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  completedLessons: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId }],
});
module.exports = mongoose.model('Enrollment', enrollmentSchema);


4. Feedback Model

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const feedbackSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  course: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Course' },
  student: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
  rating: Number,
  comment: String,
});
module.exports = mongoose.model('Feedback', feedbackSchema);
